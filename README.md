# Gravity Simulator

## Todo

1. Gravity (Masses pulling towards each other)
   (mass of object 1 _ mass of object 2 _ Gravitational Constant) / distance ^ 2

   = g force which can convert to acceleration (it's a measure of acceleration after all)

   Each object will exert gravity ... on each other. Changing its acceleration.

2. Convert to 3d

3. Convert Gravity to consider relativity

Matter curving space-time. Normal force is resisting. Space tells matter how to move, matter tells space how to curve.

Grid to show natural curvature of spacetime.

Could do 2d grid. Might try 3d. Idk if I'm Him.

4. spawn objects in + UI to add things.

5. UI with prerendered/determined shapes. like the solar system
